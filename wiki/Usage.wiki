===Requisites===

As a Java application you need JRE installed in whatever the target system is.

JAR files are often compiled using the latest JDK available.

Path: both relative and absolute path forms can be used, be sure you use "\\" (instead of a single backslash) when running the application on Windows OS.


===How to make it run===

  # download the JAR file, from _*Downloads*_ tab.
  # move it to a target directory
  # run: {{{java -jar udmlparser.jar}}}
  # check the required parameters
  # run the application, append required parameters.
