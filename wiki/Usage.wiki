===Requisites===

  * As a Java application you need JRE installed in whatever the target system is.

  * JAR files are often compiled using the latest JDK available.

  * Path: both relative and absolute path forms can be used, be sure you use "\\" (instead of a single backslash) when running the application on Windows OS.


===How to make it run===

  # download the JAR file, from _*Downloads*_ tab.
  # move it to a target directory
  # run: {{{java -jar udmlparser0_5.jar}}}
  # check the required parameters

Now you need to extract UDML code out of your repository file, do that using nqUDMLgen tool (provided OOTB with OBIEE, check {{{OBIHOME/server/Bin}}} (run it using -n -q -8 flags).

  * run the application, append required parameters.
eg: {{{java -jar udmlparser0_4.jar -udml=paintUDML.txt -rpdxml=paintUDML.xml}}}
